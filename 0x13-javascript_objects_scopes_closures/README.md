# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, we will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What 'this' means
- What 'undefined' means
- Why the variable type and scope is important
- What is a closure
- What is a prototype
- How to inherit an object from another

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x). [Rules of Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc
