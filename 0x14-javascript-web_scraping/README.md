# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use request and fetch API
- How to read and write a file using fs module

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/node```
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should be ```semistandard``` compliant (version 16.x.x). [Rules of Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using ```wc```
- Not allowed to use ```var```

## Install Node 14
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Install semi-standard
```
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Install request module and use it
```
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```

Notes: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
