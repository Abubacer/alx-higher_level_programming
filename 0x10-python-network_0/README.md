## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ```python3``` (version 3.8.5)
- All Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (```wc -l file``` should print 3)
- All files should end with a new line

- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All files must be executable
- The Bash script must pass ```Shellcheck``` (version 0.3.7) without any error
- The Python files should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
- The first line of all Python files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- The ```curl``` commands must have the option ```-s``` (silent mode)
- All modules should be documented: ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```
- All classes should be documented: ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)''```
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'```
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
