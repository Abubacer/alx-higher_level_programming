# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, we will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to run a JavaScript script
- How to create variables and constants
- What are differences between var, const and let
- What are all the data types available in JavaScript
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use while and for loops
- How to use break and continue statements
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does a function that does not use any return statement return
- Scope of variables
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to manipulate dictionary
- How to import a file
